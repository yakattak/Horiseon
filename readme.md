Added comments to both the CSS and the HTML in order to make more clear what each section and style did


Cleaned up the CSS.  Each of the main content blocks used the same stylings and so could be combined

Each of the benefits could also be combined

After this the time it would take to make it more efficient probably wasn't worth the effort (diminishing returns)
